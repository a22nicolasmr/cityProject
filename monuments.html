    <h2>The Cathedral</h2>

    <p><em>The beautiful Cathedral</em> </p>
    <p>The Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela is the most outstanding work of Romanesque art in Spain. It is also the final destination of all the Caminos de Santiago, which for centuries have taken the pilgrims of Christianity to the tomb of an apostle. As if that were not enough, it was the inaugural stone for the construction of a monumental city, Santiago de Compostela, which was born in a sacred forest at the end of the world with the vocation of a Holy City and a World Heritage Site.
        <br>Today, with a thousand years of existence lived to the rhythm of the extraordinary history of Compostela, the Cathedral is shown as a complex set of spaces capable of rewarding the faith of walkers with its powerful spirituality and with its beauty the visitors of the world.</p>
