    <p>The history of Santiago de Compostela dates back to prehistory, the Castro culture, the arrival of the Romans and, as a turning point, the discovery of the supposed burial of the apostle Santiago.<div></div> The Asturian king Alfonso II ordered the construction of a church14 and the town was built around it. From that moment the city will be formed around the center of power represented by the Archbishop of Santiago and his physical representation, the cathedral. Since then, the Camino de Santiago has marked the future of the city.</p>
